# day-02-lab-assignment
This is the assignment that was worked on and completed during the second day lab portion. "Guessing Game".

I reopened this project on Wednesday (day 3) and have added in counting features for keeping track of the user's correct and incorrect answers.

This project is a test to see how well the user knows the creator.

Day 3 - New additions to HTML file and JS. Partner Programming. Recorded answers in website window.
