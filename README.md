# day-02-lab-assignment
This is the assignment that was worked on and completed during the second day lab portion. "Guessing Game".

I reopened this project on Wednesday (day 3) and have added in counting features for keeping track of the user's correct and incorrect answers.

This project is a test to see how well the user knows the creator.

Day 4 - New additions to HTML file and JS. Partner Programming. Recorded answers in website window.

Ok, fixed the problem, now working in Thursday branch. This is Ethan and here is my fork URL of David's guessing game.
